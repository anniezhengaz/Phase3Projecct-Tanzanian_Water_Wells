### Overview


Predicting whether water pumps in Tanzania are faulty given a feature dataset!

We know that the water is most essential substance for life on earth, and a lot of people around the world have no access to it!
16 out of 59 million people in Tanzania lack access to safe water , people living in such circumstances , are forced to travel long distances ,  few or more miles a day to collect water for basic needs ,sometimes  several trips a day,  particulary  women and children!
In this project we used 3 models to perform clasification of the functionality of the water wells in Tanzania
The best predictions we had using Random Forest , very powerfull method, where we apply oversampling and tuned the method to come up to even better predictibility !


### Business and Data Understanding

Like we said in our overview 1/4 of the population in Tanzania has no access to safe water.From all the water points established in this country a lot of them are either non functional or need repair.
The models we did in this project will help Beyond Well app to predict better what wells are in need for repair based on the important features we extracted from the data given.
Also this features can contribute to overall maintenance operations of the wells and help to ensure clean and safe water to more people accross the country!
Our goal is to add a new feauture to Well Beyond app to predict if a well needs a repair like we said previously!

The Well Beyond app in co-op with NGO (non - governemental - organisation) created this great app to help people and local comunities in Tanzania to show functionality of the waterwells!
So to make it even more funtional this great app we are proposing this feature using the data from https://www.drivendata.org/ using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water
