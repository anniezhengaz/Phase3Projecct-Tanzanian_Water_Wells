### Project Overview

The Well Beyond app, developed by Well Aware, has been revolutionary in providing insights to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) about the status of wells. We aim to aid the Well Beyond app by adding a feature predicting the functionality of wells in Tanzania given attributes provided by the [Tanzanian Ministry of Water](https://www.maji.go.tz/). Using the provided dataset, we have developed models that can predict the functionality of wells with upwards of 86.4% accuracy.


### Background Story
Water is the most essential substance for life on earth, and many people around the world have limited access.

In Tanzania, 16 out of 59 million people lack access to safe water, and can be forced to travel long distances (>3 miles on average) to collect water for basic needs every day.

### Business and Data Understanding

Like we said in our overview 1/4 of the population in Tanzania has no access to safe water.From all the water points established in this country a lot of them are either non functional or need repair.
The models we did in this project will help Beyond Well app to predict better what wells are in need for repair based on the important features we extracted from the data given.
Also this features can contribute to overall maintenance operations of the wells and help to ensure clean and safe water to more people accross the country!
Our goal is to add a new feauture to Well Beyond app to predict if a well needs a repair like we said previously!

The Well Beyond app in co-op with NGO (non - governemental - organisation) created this great app to help people and local comunities in Tanzania to show functionality of the waterwells!
So to make it even more funtional this great app we are proposing this feature using the data from https://www.drivendata.org/ using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water
