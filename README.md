### Project Overview

The [Well Beyond](https://www.wellbeyondwater.com/) app, developed by Well Aware, has been revolutionary in providing insights to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) about the status of wells. We aim to aid the Well Beyond app by adding a feature predicting the functionality of wells in Tanzania given attributes provided by the [Tanzanian Ministry of Water](https://www.maji.go.tz/). Using the provided dataset, we have developed models that can predict the functionality of wells with upwards of 86.4% accuracy.

### Background and Motivation
Water is essential substance for life on Earth, and many people around the world have limited access. In Tanzania, 16 out of 59 million people lack access to safe water, and can be forced to travel long distances (>3 miles on average) to collect water for basic needs every day. 

Gaining a better understanding of where wells need repair can help direct funding and resources to the places of greatest need, thus ensuring people in dire need of water can gain safe access.

### Business and Data Understanding

Nearly half the wells in the Ministry of Water's dataset were completely non-functional or in need of repair 
|||| INSERT ANNIE PLOT OF DISTRIBUTION OF WELL FUNCTIONALITY ||||

Using these labels of *functional*, *non-functional*, or *functional needs repair*, we can develop machine learning models that classify well functionality with some key well features, including location, water level, construction year, and type. 

We have determined three key business goals:
1. Insert our predictive model into the Well Beyond app to help NGOs better allocate resources for maintenance operations.
2. Determine key features with the highest predictive power on well functionality to decide what data needs to be gathered.
3. Recommend features of wells that may be useful for gaining better predictability of well status.

### Explain your stakeholder audience and dataset choice here




The Well Beyond app in co-op with NGO (non - governemental - organisation) created this great app to help people and local comunities in Tanzania to show functionality of the waterwells!
So to make it even more funtional this great app we are proposing this feature using the data from https://www.drivendata.org/ using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water
