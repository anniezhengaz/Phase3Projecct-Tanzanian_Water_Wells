Explain your stakeholder audience and dataset choice here

Modeling

Evaluation

Conclusion

Just like in Phase 1 and 2, the README.md file should be the bridge between your non technical presentation and the Jupyter Notebook. It should not contain the code used to develop your analysis, but should provide a more in-depth explanation of your methodology and analysis than what is described in your presentation slides.
